# WonderForest Demo Scenario

## Suggested Hackathon Starting Topic

> **I’m wondering about how to design a future work life that feels meaningful.**

---

## Why This Topic Works

- Broad enough to branch into multiple directions  
- Personally relatable to most audiences  
- Emotionally engaging and reflective  
- Surfaces values, trade-offs, identity, and assumptions  
- Demonstrates the power of wandering instead of answering

# Mock Conversation Flow

## Step 1 — User Enters Topic

**User:**  
I’m wondering about how to design a future work life that feels meaningful.

---

## Step 2 — WonderForest Generates Branches

**WonderForest:**  
When you say *meaningful work life*, I see multiple paths to explore.  
Choose a branch to begin:

1. **Clarify what “meaningful” means to you**  
2. **Challenge your assumptions about work and meaning**  
3. **Zoom out to the larger life context**  
4. **Shift perspective**  
5. **Take a wild trail**

(You can return to any path later.)

---

## Step 3 — User Selects a Path

**User:**  
Let’s clarify what “meaningful” means to me.

---

## Step 4 — Branch Expands

**WonderForest:**  
When you think *meaningful*, which dimension feels most alive right now?

A. Contribution — impacting others  
B. Growth — stretching intellectually or skill-wise  
C. Autonomy — choosing how you spend your time  
D. Recognition — being appreciated  

You can choose one, combine options, or redefine your own.

---

## Step 5 — User Chooses Combination

**User:**  
Contribution and Autonomy.

---

## Step 6 — Deeper Exploration

**WonderForest:**  
Interesting combination. Let’s explore the tension between them.

- What trade-offs might exist between impact and independence?  
- What assumptions are you making about each?  
- What would contribution look like if you defined it on your own terms?

Choose a direction:

1. Explore trade-offs  
2. Surface hidden assumptions  
3. Redefine contribution  

---

## Step 7 — User Chooses Trade-offs

**User:**  
Explore trade-offs.

---

## Step 8 — Friction Introduced

**WonderForest:**  
Consider this:

- Working within institutions may maximize scale of impact but reduce autonomy.  
- Independent work may maximize autonomy but reduce systemic reach.

Which feels more aligned right now?

1. Deep impact for a few  
2. Broad impact for many  
3. Neither — redefine the metric of impact

# What This Demonstrates

- Visible branching paths  
- Structured cognitive friction  
- Perspective shifts and value clarification  
- Non-linear exploration  
- Ability to revisit untaken paths

# Alternative Demo Starting Topics

If needed, consider:

- I’m wondering about how to make better decisions under uncertainty.  
- I’m wondering about what success really means for me.  
- I’m wondering about how to build habits that last.  
- I’m wondering about how to balance ambition and wellbeing.  
- I’m wondering about how AI is shaping the future of human thinking.  

Each of these topics supports rich branching, abstraction shifts, and reflective exploration.
